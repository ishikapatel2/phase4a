# Phase 4a


-- Testcase 00 should be passing - the start and end time vary, but all within a reasonable time frame

-- Testcase 01 should be passing - all processes have similar expected vs actual wake up times and all have same priority

-- Testcase 02 should be passing - the timing for each process after sleeping for its designated amount of time is slightly off and the expected pid for each process differs from the actual pid which is ok
